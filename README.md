## General Information
- Problem Statement :
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them at a higher price. 
The company wants to know:
  - Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
  - How well those variables describe the price of a house.
Business Goal:
To model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. Based on this data they can manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. The model should help the management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
Analytical Goals:
- A regression model using regularization in order to predict the actual value of the 
 prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
- Determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression. 
- Determine which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house and 
- Establish how well those variables describe the price of a house.

Data set used is train.csv available in this git
